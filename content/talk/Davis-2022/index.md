summary: I discuss the "swampland", a vast landscape of consistent-looking linguistic theories who don't obey constraints on the generative capacity of the functions they model, and contrast with a "landscape" of consistent and obedient theories.
abstract: A central concern of linguistic theory is determining necessary and sufficient conditions on the generative capacity of the grammars/functions which account for linguistic phenomena. Prior work shows that while the landscape of possible functions is vast, the range of "things linguistic" is tightly constrained. In this talk I will review some recent mathematical work describing (1) conditions on the generative capacity of phenomena independent of a particular framework, using techniques from mathematical logic, and (2) classifying different linguistic theories with respect to these mathematical conditions. The key lesson is that many linguistic theories lie in what I call the "swampland", a vast area where the capacity of the theories does not obey these constraints, even if the theories are themselves internally consistent-looking.
