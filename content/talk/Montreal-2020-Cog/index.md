summary: I discuss the scope and limits of linguistic generalization in human and nonhuman animals using formal language theory.
abstract: "This talk discusses the scope and limits of linguistic generalization in human and nonhuman animals using formal language theory. Formal language classes describe necessary and sufficient conditions for recognizing patterns of a given kind. The hierarchy of these classes form a fine-grained complexity measure that is independent of the implementation details of the cognitive mechanism. This provides a basis for making inferences about cognitive mechanisms that are valid regardless of how those mechanisms are actually realized. Results in this area show that generalization is both modular and constrained: human generalization differs across syntactic and phonological domains, while animal generalization is more similar to human phonology than human syntax. Tradeoffs in representation and computation refine these results to either the computational capacity of human and nonhuman learners, or different representations of linguistic data structures. These results provide a solid theoretical basis for experiments testing where the nature of biases in language and learning comes from both within and across species."
