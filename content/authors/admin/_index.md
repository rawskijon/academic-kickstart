I teach courses on general and computational linguistics at <a href="https://www.sjsu.edu/linguistics/">San Jose State University</a>. During summers and winters I am in Paris, transiently at the <a href="https://cognition.ens.fr">Institut Jean Nicod/ENS DEC</a>. In 2023/2024, I am on leave to visit and teach at <a href="https://linguistics.mit.edu/">MIT Linguistics</a>. I generally study the mathematics of human language and learning. My work places mathematical boundary conditions or "no-go theorems" on the grammars underlying human language and how they can be learned. These properties reflect humans' unique neuronal structure and computational power, contributing foundational principles for the cognitive and computer sciences.
