I am an Assistant Professor of Linguistics at <a href="https://www.sjsu.edu/linguistics/">San Jose State University</a>, where I teach courses on general and computational linguistics. My work generally concerns the mathematics of human language and learning. These cognitive feats emerge from humans' unique neuronal structure and computing power, allowing linguistic insight to contribute to the broader cognitive sciences and artificial intelligence.
